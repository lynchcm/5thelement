desc1: "Being a listening ear and helping people work through their problems has always been my passion. I believe that nothing happens in isolation, and I help my clients take a whole picture approach to evaluating problems, uncovering hidden understand hidden connections and patterns to build self awareness. This not only helps with current challenges, but gives you the tools and confidence to tackle whatever life may throw at you. All coaching happens in a supportive, conversational style - no pressure or expectations, just reflection, exploration and discussion."
desc3: "All sessions are a low pressure discussion - think of it as a conversation with a supportive friend, but with no expectations or bias. Before getting started, we always set some goals, chatting about what it is you’d like to get out of our sessions. During the sessions, I’ll subtly structure our conversation through gentle guidance and prompts to help you meet your goals. Most people find that three to five sessions helps resolve present challenges and give them the confidence to tackle future situations, but every person and situation is unique."
